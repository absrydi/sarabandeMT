[Standalone Version](https://beauprograming.blogspot.com/2024/09/pemutar-musik-sarabande.html)

## Main Commands

Commands that will be interpreted by the program.

### ```time (n)```

Set the time signature's numerator. The time signature's denominator is always 4.

- n: Time signature's numerator (default: 4).

### ```tempo (n)```

Set the music tempo in BPM / MM.

- n: Tempo in BPM / MM (default: 120).

### ```tuning (n)tet```

Set the music tuning with the Equal Temprament system.

- n: Number of notes in 1 octave from 2 - 26 (default: 12).

### ```setvar (name) (value)```

Declare a variable with a value (in number). Can be used if a value is used extensively.

- name: Variable name / callsign.
- value: Variable value in number. can be decimal or round.

### ```remvar (name)```

Remove the called variable.

- name: Variable name / callsign to be removed.

### ```next (beat)```

Go to the next beat.

- beat: How much beat to be skipped.

### ```note (pitch) (duration) (voice)```

Play a note. ^(See "Extra: Note")^

- pitch: Note pitch.
- duration: Note duration in Beat(s).
- voice: Note voice / sound index.

### ```dynamics (volume)```

Set the playing dynamics (volume) ^(See "Preprocessing Commands ยง Dynamics")^

- volume: How loud the next notes should be played (default: 100 [0 - 100]).

### ```transpose (semitones)```

Set the pitch transposition

- semitones: How much transposition (in semitones) the next notes should be played (default: 0 [-47 - 48]).

### ```finetune (cents)```

Set the fine tuning in cents

- cents: Trim/Fine tune (in cents) the next notes (default: 0 [-1200 - 1200]).

### ```end```

Ends the music with one bar (required in every music file as an EOF identifier).

### ```## (comment)```

Comments. Can be used to write some comments. Does not interpreted and pre-processed by the program.

- comment: Comments.

## Preprocessing Commands

Commands that will be pre-processed before interpreted by the program. To get the idea what is preprocessing, here is an example:

Before preprocessing:

	dynamics piano

After preprocessing:

	dynamics 40

The "Before preprocessing" example is what you write in the music file. Then it will be preprocessed by the Preprocessing Unit. Preprocessed music file then will be interpreted by the main interpreter.

### ```getvar (name)``` or ```gv (name)```

Return the called variable's value.

- name: Variable name / callsign to be returned its value.

### Dynamics

| Preprocessing Commands | Volume |
|------------------------|--------|
| "pianissimo" or "pp"	 | 25     |
| "piano"	or "p"		 | 40     |
| "mezzopiano" or "mp"	 | 50     |
| "mezzoforte" or "mf"	 | 60     |
| "forte" or "f"		 | 75     |
| "fortissimo" or "ff"	 | 100    |

Dynamics preprocessed commands can be used with the main "dynamics" command for changing dynamics.

### Arithmetic Operators ```*```, ```/```, ```+``` and ```-```

Arithmetic operators with the Order of Operation rule. Space is required between number and operators.

## Extra: Custom Voices

You can add custom voices by adding a voice element ```{audio_file, is_looped, is_ring}``` into the voices table in ```init.lua``` file.

```

	{"piano", false, false},
	{"smoothy", false, false},
	{"sparkle", false, false},
	{"rhodes", false, false},
	{"harpsichord", false, false},

	{"principal_org", true, false},
	{"gedackt_org", true, false},
	{"sine", true, false}, -- 10
	{"nylon_gtr", false, false},
